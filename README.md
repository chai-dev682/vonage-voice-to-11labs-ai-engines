# Reference application using Vonage Voice API to connect Voice Calls to AI Engines

## Set up

### Set up the sample basic middleware server - Host server public hostname and port

First set up the basic middleware server from one of the following repositories</br>
https://github.com/nexmo-se/dg-oai-11l-connector,</br>
https://github.com/nexmo-se/elevenlabs-agent-ws-connector,</br>
https://github.com/nexmo-se/openai-realtime-connector,</br>
https://github.com/nexmo-se/websocket-server-variant-3.</br>

Default local (not public!) of that middleware server `port` is: 6000.

If you plan to test using `Local deployment` with ngrok (Internet tunneling service) for both the sample middleware server application and this sample Voice API application, you may set up [multiple ngrok tunnels](https://ngrok.com/docs/agent/config/#tunnel-configurations).

For the next steps, you will need:
- That middleware public hostname and if necessary public port,</br>
e.g. `xxxxxxxx.ngrok.io`, `xxxxxxxx.herokuapp.com`, `myserver.mycompany.com:32000`  (as **`PROCESSOR_SERVER`**),</br>
no `port` is necessary with ngrok or heroku as public hostname.</br>

### Set up your Vonage Voice API application credentials and phone number

[Log in to your](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-in) or [sign up for a](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up) Vonage APIs account.

Go to [Your applications](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/applications), access an existing application or [+ Create a new application](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/applications/new).

Under Capabilities section (click on [Edit] if you do not see this section):

Enable Voice
- Under Answer URL, leave HTTP GET, and enter https://\<host\>:\<port\>/answer (replace \<host\> and \<port\> with the public host name and if necessary public port of the server where this sample application is running)</br>
- Under Event URL, **select** HTTP POST, and enter https://\<host\>:\<port\>/event (replace \<host\> and \<port\> with the public host name and if necessary public port of the server where this sample application is running)</br>
Note: If you are using ngrok for this sample application, the answer URL and event URL look like:</br>
https://yyyyyyyy.ngrok.io/answer</br>
https://yyyyyyyy.ngrok.io/event</br> 	
- Click on [Generate public and private key] if you did not yet create or want new ones, save the private key file in this application folder as .private.key (leading dot in the file name).</br>
**IMPORTANT**: Do not forget to click on [Save changes] at the bottom of the screen if you have created a new key set.</br>
- Link a phone number to this application if none has been linked to the application.

Please take note of your **application ID** and the **linked phone number** (as they are needed in the very next section).

For the next steps, you will need:</br>
- Your [Vonage API key](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings) (as **`API_KEY`**)</br>
- Your [Vonage API secret](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings), not signature secret, (as **`API_SECRET`**)</br>
- Your `application ID` (as **`APP_ID`**),</br>
- The **`phone number linked`** to your application (as **`SERVICE_PHONE_NUMBER`**), your phone will **call that number**,</br>

### Local setup

Copy or rename .env-example to .env<br>
Update parameters in .env file<br>
Have Node.js installed on your system, this application has been tested with Node.js version 18.19<br>

Install node modules with the command:<br>
 ```bash
npm install
```

Launch the application:<br>
```bash
node voice-to-ai-engines
```
Default local (not public!) of this application server `port` is: 8000.

### How to make PSTN calls

#### Inbound calling

Call the **`phone number linked`** to your application to get connected to the Conversational AI Agent.

#### Outbound calling

To manually trigger an outbound PSTN call to a number, open a web browser, enter the address:<br>

_https://\<server-address\>/call?callee=\<number\>_<br>

the \<number\> must be in E.164 format without leading '+' sign, or '-', '.' characters

for example, it looks like

https://xxxx.ngrok.app/call?callee=12995551212

Upon answering the call, the callee will get connected to the Conversational AI Agent.
